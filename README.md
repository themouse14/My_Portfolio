# My_Portfolio

## AS A DEVELOPER

I WANT TO CREATE A PORTFOLIO THAT ACCURATELY DISPLAYS MY SKILLS, NOT ONLY IN WHAT THE EMPLOYER CAN READ, BUT ALSO GETTING AS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE USING A PROGRAM I DEVELOPED.

THE BETTER THE USER EXPERIENCE, THE MORE LIKELY THE EMPLOYER WILL WANT TO HIRE ME.

## AS A USER

I WANT THE WEBPAGE TO BE EASY TO NAVIGATE, FUN TO READ, BUT NOT DISTRACTING OR OVER DECORATED.

## AS AN EMPLOYER

I AM LOOKING FOR A CLEAN, INTERACTIVE PAGE THAT SHOWS THE SKILLS OF THE DEVELOPER. AS AN EMPLYER I WANT MY USERS TO NAVIGATE THE PAGE EASILY, EFFECTIVELY, WITH ELEMENTS THAT REPRESENT US AS A COMPANY.
